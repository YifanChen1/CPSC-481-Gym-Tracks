Navigate into the Gym-Tracks folder where Gym-Tracks.csproj is located and then type dotnet watch run Gym-Tracks/Gym-Tracks.csproj into your terminal to run the program.

Run the program on Google Chrome, and once it is running, right click to inspect the page.

When you have done this, a small bar above the program will appear that says "Dimensions:"

Click this, and select iPhone 12 Pro from the list.

## USING THE APPLICATION ONCE YOU ARE SET UP 

Now you are ready to use the application.

There are four primary pages that you will be accessing, which are represented by the four symbols on the bottom of the application screen which are in order: Workout, Discovery, Activity, and About You.

First click the list image in the bottom right corner to go to the About You page.
On this page, click the gear icon in the top right of the window to go to the Settings page, and select the Tutorial button to be given full details on how to use the system.

After having viewed the tutorial, I will go into how to interact with the four main pages.

Workout: This page, represented by a man carrying weights, will be blank with a button with a plus symbol on it. Click the button to get the option to add an exercise, or add a routine. Selecting add an exercise will take you to the discovery page, which info for can be viewed below. If you have added any workouts from the discovery page, you can select the "reps" and "lbs" box and enter number values to them (do not enter non-number values or there will be an error) (although this is possible in the current version, the complete version would have a number pad, which would make entering illegal values not possible.) you can enter values or leave it with what is already in there, and when you are happy with the values you can press "Complete Set" to add a new set of values, which can be scrolled left and right to see. If you want to remove an exercise, simply click the "remove" button in the top right corner of the exercise. Selecting add a routine will take you to the routines page. If you click "add to workout", the exercises in the chosen routine will be added to the workout. If you wish to remove this routine, simply click the same button again, which will have changed appearance to purple and say "added to workout". If you remove a value in the routine directly from the workout, there will be an error, so avoid doing this. If you click the name instead, you will see the list of exercises within the routine. The "plus" button on the routines page will give you the option to make a new routine. Click it and it will bring you to the new routine page, where clicking the "plus" button will allow you to select an exercise to add to the new routine. Unfortunately, this will add an exercise to the workout not the routine due to issues in the design. You also cannot add the new blank routine as a routine either.

Discovery: On this page, which is represented by a magnifying glass, there are a series of buttons and a search bar. If you click a button, you will be brought to a list of exercises in that category. You can click "add to workout" on any of these exercises to add them to the workout. The button will then become purple and read "added to workout", and if you click it in this state, it will remove it from the workout. If you click on the search bar in the main page, you can enter the name of a workout and if it exists it will show up in a list, where you can select and deselect it in the same fashion as before.

Activity: On this page, which is represented by a calendar, you can see your previous exercises. You can click the two arrow buttons at the top to switch months, and you can click any date in the calendar to see the workout that was done that day. If you click the button with the month and year on it, you will go out to a monthly view, where you can select a chosen month to view although this is not currently functioning, and if you click it again it is intended to bring you to a yearly view, although this currently causes a crash.

About you: On this page, which is represented by a checklist, there are many things to interact with. Starting from the top, if you click the bell icon, you will see your notifications, which you can click to go to the pages they pertain to, which in this case are the achievements page, the activity page, and the routines page from top to bottom. If you click the gear icon next to it in the top right corner, you will have access to the settings page, where you can click "start" to view the tutorial, or select the default page the application will open to, although this functionality is not currently implemented. If you click the red "Routines" panel, you will be sent to the routines page as detailed in the "Workout" section above. If you click the orange "Achievements" panel, you will be brought to the achievements page, where you can view your past achievements. Currently the top left most achievement is clickable and will bring up a page you can click the x button to exit. You can also click the buttons on the "Achievements" panel to access this information straight from the about you screen, although only the left-most button is functional currently. If you click the purple "Progress" panel, you will be brought to the progress page, where you can see information on exercises that you engage in frequently, although these graphs are just static images in this version of the prototype.
